**What** 
 - Explain the changes you've made. 
 - It doesn't need to be fancy or technical, just explicit prose on the change. 
 - Reference a ticket in your issue if appropriate, but by all means, don't just reference the ticket. 

**Why**
 - Explain the engineering goal this change achieves but also some higher-level goal that is satisfied. 

**How**
 - Brief explanation of the approach taken and design decisions. 

**Testing**
 - Which tests have been added or updated.
 - Explain the steps to test this change and let the reviewer also know if some conditions or edge cases were not tested, why they weren't tested, and any associated risks.

**Screenshots**
 - This applies to UI-related tasks. A simple screenshot of the before and after helps the reviewer to understand the current state vs the development state.

**Anything else**
 - You might want to call out challenges, technical debts, etc.
